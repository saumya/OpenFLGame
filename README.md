Demo for raymp
==========================
RayComp or [raymp][1] demo repository.          

The component library is moved to its own repository.

If using the library directly, then as usual with other Haxelibs, add the library folder path manually to your project compiler arguements.
```
haxelib dev raymp /Users/saumya/haxelibs/raymp/
```
And in the project xml file add
```
<haxelib name="raymp" />
```
